These are a series of matlab/octave functions designed for the analysis
of single unit data as needed by the Morishita lab at Mt. Sinai Hospital.

Brief overview:
* db_cbi_calc: program to calculate CBI, plot the cdf of ODI, and a histogram of ODS, to be run after db_suanaly_v3
* db_convert2timestamps_(1-3): translates matrix output from neuroexplorer to timestamp data
* db_optoanaly: makes psths, rasters, and a plot of ISIs for experiments with optogenetic stimulation
* db_preparepsth: prepares standard psths for db_suanaly
* db_suanaly_v(1-3): makes bin and smooth psths, rasters, and calculates ODI, ODS, firing rates, etc. for ocular dominance experiments
